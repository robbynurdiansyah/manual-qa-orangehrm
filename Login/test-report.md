| Total Cases | Passed | Failed | Blocked |
|-------------|--------|--------|---------|
| 10          | 9     | 1      | 0       |

### ‚ùå Failed Test Case:
- TC-009 ‚Äì [See BUG-001](https://github.com/robbynurdiansyah/manual-qa-orangehrm/blob/main/Login/bug-reports.md)

### Conclusion:
The login functionality is mostly stable with one failed test. The failure occurred due to the absence of an error message and redirect when accessing the dashboard without logging in.
Most test scenarios passed. However, one critical issue remains unhandled when invalid login attempts are made. Error messaging is missing.
